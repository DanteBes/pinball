# Welcome to My GitHub

Hello everyone, Dante Besfalin here! I'm new to GitHub. A bit about myself: I'm 23, a self-taught programmer learning through YouTube tutorials. But there's another thing - I do everything with my nose on a tablet through SPCK Editor due to my disability. I have cerebral palsy (CP) from birth, and I can't use professional devices and their capabilities.

## About This Repository

I created this game a few years ago following YouTube tutorials, but since the author didn't finish the tutorial playlist, my friend and I had to complete the game ourselves. Since my friend wrote 95% of the code, I distanced myself a bit because I didn't consider it my project anymore. However, I decided not to discard the project but to keep it. I recommend checking out my [portfolio](https://dantebes.github.io/portfolio/).
